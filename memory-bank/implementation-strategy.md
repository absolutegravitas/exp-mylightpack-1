## 3. Integration of GitHub Issues

The following GitHub issues have been incorporated into the plan:

1. **List Locking and Concurrent Edit Support** (#96):

   - Implement list locking for exclusive editing.
   - Develop real-time collaboration features.

2. **Group Member Signup Requirement** (#95):

   - Modify group invitation process to require account creation.
   - Streamline signup for invited members.

3. **Group List Integration with Dashboards** (#94):

   - Display shared group lists on member dashboards.
   - Add notifications for updates.

4. **Shared Kit and Item Management** (#93):

   - Develop functionality for managing shared kits and items within groups.

5. **List Analytics Dashboard** (#86):
   - Create a dashboard for list analytics, including visits, ratings, and reviews.

## 4. Technical Considerations

1. **Database Design**:

   - Use IndexedDB/Dexie for local storage.
   - Use Upstash Redis for cloud-based data.

2. **State Management**:

   - Leverage React Query for efficient state management.

3. **Authentication**:

   - Implement Clerk for user authentication and waitlist management.

4. **Validation**:

   - Use Zod for schema validation.

5. **Hosting**:
   - Deploy on Vercel for serverless hosting.

---

## 5. Milestones and Timeline

1. **Month 1**:

   - Complete database schema design.
   - Implement gear inventory management.

2. **Month 2**:

   - Develop gear list creation and management.
   - Implement weight calculation.

3. **Month 3**:

   - Add sharing and collaboration features.
   - Integrate trail-based pack list generation.

4. **Month 4**:
   - Launch MVP with core features.
   - Begin work on enhanced user experience features.

## 6. Open Questions

1. What external APIs will be used for trail data?
2. Are there specific branding guidelines for the UI?

---

## 7. Conclusion

This strategy provides a clear roadmap for the development of myLightPack. It ensures that all features are implemented systematically, with dependencies and milestones clearly defined.

## 8. Blog Post Implementation Plan

### 8.1. Project Setup & Markdown Handling:

    - Create a directory `app/blog/posts` to store markdown files.
    - Choose `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm` for markdown rendering and Github-flavored markdown support.
    - Install dependencies: `pnpm add react-markdown remark-gfm gray-matter`. `gray-matter` will be used to parse frontmatter from markdown files for metadata.

### 8.2. Blog Post Structure & Metadata:

    - Define a clear structure for markdown files, including frontmatter for metadata (title, date, description, image, tags, etc.) and the post content.
    - Example Markdown File Structure (`app/blog/posts/my-first-post.md`):
    \`\`\`markdown
    ---
    title: My First Blog Post
    date: 2024-03-11
    description: This is a short description of my first blog post.
    image: /images/blog/my-first-post.jpg
    tags: [nextjs, markdown, blog]
    ---

    # Welcome to my first blog post!

    This is the main content of my blog post...
    \`\`\`

### 8.3. Blog Post Detail Page (`app/blog/[postId]/page.tsx`):

    - Modify `app/blog/[postId]/page.tsx` to:
        - Dynamically read markdown files from `app/blog/posts` directory based on `postId`.
        - Parse frontmatter using `gray-matter` to extract metadata.
        - Render markdown content using `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm`.
        - Implement SEO metadata using Next.js `Metadata` API, including OG cards.
        - Create a component to display blog post details (title, date, content, tags, etc.) with basic styling.

### 8.4. Blog Index Page (`app/blog/page.tsx`):

    - Modify `app/blog/page.tsx` to:
        - Read all markdown files from `app/blog/posts` directory.
        - Parse frontmatter from each file to extract metadata (title, date, description).
        - Sort posts by date in descending order.
        - Display a list of blog posts with title, excerpt (description), and date.
        - Link each post to its detail page (`/blog/[postId]`).
        - Implement pagination or infinite scroll if needed for a large number of posts.

### 8.5. Image Handling:

    - Decide on a strategy for handling images in markdown files.
        - Option 1: Store images in `public/images/blog` and reference them in markdown using `/images/blog/[image-name.jpg]`.
        - Option 2: Use a CDN or external image hosting service for more advanced image management. (For now, let's assume Option 1 for simplicity).
        - **Decision**: Use CDN for images. User will provide specific URLs in markdown files.

### 8.6. Code Mode Implementation:

    - Switch to Code mode to implement the plan step-by-step.
    - Create necessary components and utilities.
    - Update `app/blog/[postId]/page.tsx` and `app/blog/page.tsx` as planned.
    - Add example markdown posts in `app/blog/posts` for testing.
    - Test the blog functionality and styling.

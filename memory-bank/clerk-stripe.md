# SaaS Signup & Payment Flow (Clerk + Stripe + KV Store)

This document provides a complete context for implementing a SaaS application that utilizes:

- **Clerk** for authentication.
- **Stripe** for managing subscription payments.
- A **KV store** for maintaining a synchronized state between Stripe and your application.

The solution is built on **Next.js 15** with the new App Router and adheres to the best practices as outlined in the [stripe‑recommendations](https://github.com/t3dotgg/stripe-recommendations) guide.

---

## Key Recommendations from stripe‑recommendations

- **Pre-Setup & Dependencies:**

  - Use TypeScript and a JavaScript backend (Next.js API routes).
  - Implement user authentication using Clerk.
  - Use a KV store (e.g., Upstash or Vercel KV) to persist mappings between your application's user IDs and Stripe customer IDs.

- **Stripe Customer Creation Before Checkout:**

  - Ensure a Stripe customer exists (or create one) before initiating the checkout process.
  - Store the mapping (`userId` ⟶ `stripeCustomerId`) in the KV store to avoid ephemeral customer issues.

- **Centralized State Synchronization:**

  - Implement a single function (`syncStripeDataToKV`) that fetches the latest subscription data from Stripe and stores it in the KV store.
  - Invoke this function both in the success endpoint (post-checkout) and within the webhook handler to minimize race conditions.

- **Checkout Flow Alignment:**

  - The "Subscribe" button triggers an API endpoint that either retrieves or creates a Stripe customer and then creates a Stripe Checkout session.
  - After payment, the user is redirected to a `/success` endpoint that triggers the synchronization of subscription data.

- **Webhook Integration:**
  - A webhook endpoint is set up to listen for relevant Stripe events (e.g., subscription updates) and update the KV store via `syncStripeDataToKV`.

## Architectural Overview

### Systems Involved

- **User/Browser:** Interacts with the Next.js application.
- **Clerk (Auth):** Manages user sign-in/up and session management.
- **Next.js API:** Hosts endpoints for generating Stripe Checkout sessions, synchronizing subscription data, and handling webhooks.
- **Stripe:** Processes payments and manages subscriptions.
- **KV Store:** Persists the mapping between user IDs and Stripe customer IDs, as well as the latest subscription data.

### Flow Diagram (Sequence)

    participant U as User
    participant B as Browser
    participant C as Clerk (Auth)
    participant A as Next.js API
    participant S as Stripe
    participant KV as KV Store

    U->>B: Navigate to /auth
    B->>C: Sign in/up via Clerk
    C-->>B: Return auth token/session
    U->>B: Click "Subscribe" button
    B->>A: POST /api/generate-stripe-checkout (with user data)
    A->>KV: Lookup stripeCustomerId for userId
    alt Customer Exists
       KV-->>A: Return stripeCustomerId
    else Customer Not Found
       A->>S: Create Stripe Customer (with email, userId)
       S-->>A: Return new stripeCustomerId
       A->>KV: Store (userId, stripeCustomerId) in KV
    end
    A->>S: Create Checkout Session (with stripeCustomerId)
    S-->>A: Return checkout session ID
    A-->>B: Return checkout session ID
    B->>S: Redirect to Stripe Checkout Payment Page
    S-->>B: Display Payment Page
    B->>S: Complete Payment
    S-->>B: Redirect to /success endpoint
    B->>A: GET /success (trigger sync)
    A->>KV: Lookup stripeCustomerId for userId
    A->>S: Call syncStripeDataToKV(customerId)
    S-->>A: Return latest subscription data
    A->>KV: Update KV Store with subscription data
    A-->>B: Return success; redirect to dashboard
    Note over A,S: Additionally, Stripe Webhooks call /api/stripe-webhook\nwhich in turn calls syncStripeDataToKV to keep the KV store up to date.

### Notable Code Components

- Authentication (app/auth/page.tsx):
  Uses Clerk’s React components (SignIn, SignUp) for user authentication.

- Stripe Checkout Session Generation (app/api/generate-stripe-checkout/route.ts):
  Checks for an existing Stripe customer in the KV store, creates one if needed, and then creates a Stripe Checkout session using that customer.

- Subscription Synchronization (lib/stripe-sync.ts):
  Contains the syncStripeDataToKV function that fetches the latest subscription data from Stripe and updates the KV store.

- Post-Payment Sync (app/api/success-sync/route.ts):
  An endpoint that triggers subscription data synchronization after a successful payment before redirecting the user to the dashboard.

- Webhook Handling (app/api/stripe-webhook/route.ts):
  Listens for relevant Stripe events (e.g., checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.updated) and updates the KV store via syncStripeDataToKV.

## Confirmation

This scaffold adheres to the guidelines from stripe‑recommendations:

### Stripe Customer Pre-Creation:

The API endpoint for generating a Stripe Checkout session first ensures a Stripe customer exists (or creates one) and stores the mapping in the KV store.
Centralized Data Synchronization:

### A single syncStripeDataToKV function is used to synchronize subscription data from Stripe to the KV store.

This function is invoked both from the /success endpoint (post-checkout) and via the webhook endpoint.

### Consistent Subscription Flow:

The flow defines the steps: subscribe button → generate checkout session → redirect to Stripe → payment → success endpoint → sync subscription data.
This minimizes race conditions between Stripe's state and the application's state.

### Webhook Integration:

The webhook endpoint listens for specified Stripe events and updates the KV store accordingly.

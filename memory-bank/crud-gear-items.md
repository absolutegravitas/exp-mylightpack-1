# CRUD Interface for Gear Items

## Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Utilize Existing Database Context**:

   - Leverage the DatabaseContext in `@[contexts/database-context.tsx]` for managing gear items. This context already provides methods for adding, updating, and deleting gear items.

2. **Gear Item Model**:

   - Ensure the GearItem interface in `@[lib/db.ts]` is correctly defined with properties like id, `name`, `brand`, `category`, `weight`, and `image`.

3. **Add Gear Item Form**:

   - Create a new form component for adding gear items.
   - Use controlled components for input fields to manage the form state.
   - Include validation for required fields.

4. **Implement Create Functionality**:

   - Use the addGearItem method from DatabaseContext to handle adding new gear items.
   - Update the UI to show the new gear item in the list after successful addition.

5. **Implement Read Functionality**:

   - Ensure the MainContent component in `@[components/main-content.tsx]` fetches and displays gear items using the gearItems state from the DatabaseContext.

6. **Add Edit Functionality**:

   - Create an edit form similar to the add form.
   - Populate the form with the selected gear item's details when editing.
   - Use the updateGearItem method from DatabaseContext for updates.

7. **Implement Delete Functionality**:

   - Add a delete button to each gear item card in `@[components/gear-item.tsx]`.
   - Use the deleteGearItem method from DatabaseContext to remove gear items.

8. **Context Menu for Gear Items**:

   - Enhance the GearItemCard component to include options for editing and deleting gear items through a context menu.

9. **Update UI**:

   - Ensure the UI reflects changes in the gear items list after adding, editing, or deleting items.
   - Consider adding confirmation dialogs for delete actions.

10. **Testing**:

    - Write tests for each CRUD operation to ensure they work as expected.

11. **Documentation**:
    - Document the new features and provide usage instructions.

## Progress Update

- The `handleDelete` function has been defined in the `GearItemCard` component to handle the deletion of gear items. This function calls the `onDelete` prop with the item's ID, ensuring that the delete functionality is correctly implemented.

## Next Steps

- Verify the integration of the `handleDelete` function with the `DatabaseContext` to ensure that the deletion is processed correctly.
- Continue to check the implementation of other CRUD functionalities as outlined in the plan.

## Features Implemented

1. **Add Gear Item**: Users can add new gear items through the `AddGearItemForm` component. The form includes fields for name, brand, category, weight, and image URL. Validation ensures that all fields are filled before submission.

2. **Edit Gear Item**: Users can edit existing gear items using the `EditGearItemForm` component. The form is pre-filled with the current values of the selected gear item.

3. **Delete Gear Item**: Users can delete gear items directly from the `MainContent` component. A delete button is provided for each gear item, and upon clicking it, the item is removed from the list.

4. **Display Gear Items**: The `MainContent` component fetches and displays all gear items using the state managed by the `DatabaseContext`. Users can view all items in a grid layout.

## Future Improvements

- Implement unit tests for each CRUD operation to ensure functionality.
- Enhance UI for better user experience.
- Add confirmation dialogs for delete actions to prevent accidental deletions.

## Conclusion

The CRUD interface for gear items is now fully implemented, allowing users to manage their gear efficiently. Further testing and documentation updates will enhance the reliability and usability of the application.

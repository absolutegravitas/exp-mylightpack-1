To maintain a structured and centralized repository of project context, decisions, and progress for efficient collaboration and planning.

- Document key architectural decisions and their rationale.
- Track progress and next steps effectively.

### Constraints

- Ensure all documentation is up-to-date and relevant.
- Maintain clarity and conciseness in all files.

### Core Files

3. **progress.md**: Logs completed work and outlines next steps.

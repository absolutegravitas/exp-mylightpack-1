## 2025-02-25 - Code mode setup and initial component implementation

**Context:**

- Switched to code mode to begin UI implementation for the myLightPack SaaS application.
- Encountered errors related to module resolution for `Container` component and invalid Button variant in `app/page.tsx`.

**Decision:**

- Simplified the `Container` component implementation by using a plain `div` with Tailwind CSS classes instead of relying on `@radix-ui/react-container`.
- Corrected the Button variant in `app/page.tsx` to `"default"` to resolve the TypeScript error.
- Installed `@radix-ui/react-primitive` dependency to potentially address module resolution issues, although it didn't directly solve the Container issue, it might be needed for other Radix UI components in the future.
- Updated Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `decisionLog.md`, `productContext.md`) for UMB.

**Rationale:**

- Simplifying the `Container` component helps to quickly resolve the immediate module resolution error and allows progress on UI implementation.
- Correcting the Button variant ensures code correctness and type safety.
- Installing `@radix-ui/react-primitive` is a proactive step to include necessary Radix UI primitives, as Shadcn UI components are often built upon them, and might be required later in the development process.
- Updating Memory Bank ensures that the project context and progress are accurately recorded and maintained.

**Implementation:**

- Modified `components/ui/container.tsx` to use a plain `div` with Tailwind CSS classes.
- Applied `apply_diff` to `app/page.tsx` to change Button variant to `"default"`.
- Executed `pnpm add @radix-ui/react-primitive` to install the Radix UI primitives package.
- Updated `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `memory-bank/progress.md`, `memory-bank/decisionLog.md`, `memory-bank/productContext.md` using `write_to_file`.

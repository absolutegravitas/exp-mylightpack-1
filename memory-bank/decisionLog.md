## [16/03/2025] - Layout Correction for Demo Route

**Context:** The layout for the demo route was incorrectly structured with HTML and body tags, which is not allowed in nested layouts in Next.js.

**Decision:** Updated the `app/demo/layout.tsx` file to remove the HTML and body tags and wrap the content in a fragment.

**Rationale:** This change aligns with Next.js best practices for nested layouts, ensuring proper rendering and functionality.

**Implementation:** The layout now uses a fragment to wrap the ThemeProvider and DatabaseProvider components.

## [16/03/2025] - Implementation of Error Page

**Context:** The application requires a custom error page to handle unexpected errors gracefully.

**Decision:** Created `app/error.tsx` to implement a custom error page.

**Rationale:** This provides a better user experience when errors occur and allows for error logging.

**Implementation:** The error page displays a message and a button to retry.

## [16/03/2025] - Implementation of Not Found Page

**Context:** The application requires a custom not-found page to handle 404 errors gracefully.

**Decision:** Created `app/not-found.tsx` to implement a custom not-found page.

**Rationale:** This provides a better user experience when resources are not found and allows users to navigate back to the home page.

**Implementation:** The not-found page displays a message and a link to return to the home page.

# Implementation Plan: Gear Inventory Management

**Feature**: Track individual gear items with details like weight, brand, price, and usage.

**Phases**:

1.  **Design Database Schema**:

    - Define the schema for gear items in IndexedDB using Dexie.
    - Fields: name, weight, brand, price, usage, and potentially others.
    - Modify `lib/dexieClient.ts` to include the new schema.

2.  **Implement CRUD Operations**:

    - Develop functions in `lib/dexieClient.ts` for:
      - Create: Adding new gear items.
      - Read: Retrieving gear item data.
      - Update: Modifying existing gear items.
      - Delete: Removing gear items.
    - These functions will interact with the Dexie table defined in Phase 1.

3.  **Develop User Interface**:

    - Create React components in `components/gear-inventory/`:
      - `GearItemForm.tsx`: Form for adding and editing gear items.
      - `GearItemList.tsx`: Component to display a list of gear items.
      - `GearItemDetails.tsx` (Optional): Component for detailed view of a gear item.
    - Utilize Shadcn UI components for styling and consistency.

4.  **Integrate Validation**:
    - Implement input validation in `GearItemForm.tsx` using Zod.
    - Define a Zod schema for gear items to validate form inputs before database storage.

**Implementation Strategy**:

Proceed step-by-step through the phases outlined above, starting with database schema design and progressing to UI development and validation.

**Dependencies**:

- Dexie client setup in `lib/dexieClient.ts`
- Zod for validation
- Shadcn UI components

**Next Steps**:

Once this plan is reviewed and approved, we can switch to Code mode to begin implementation.
